# What is Coal?

+ Start with boggy land.
+ The decaying plants turn into peat.
+ The peat gets burried
+ Over  time, millions of years, turns into coal.
+ More time and more pressure (most of the time deeper), better coal.

Better means higher carbon content and BTU/lb


# What are the Kinds of Coal?

In general, the deeper the coal the older it is and the more likely it is higher quality. The names vary by country and the number of grades (ranks) differs by country.

+ Anthracite: Highest quality
+ Bituminous
+ Sub-Bituminous
+ Lignite: Lowest quality

# Coal is often separated into two major groups.

+ Metalurgical Coal: Expensive and almost pure carbon, used to make steel.  
    + Coke, which is cooked coal, like charcoal is cooked wood, is  a frequent subsitute.
+ Steam Coal: Used in electricity production.
    + "Steam Coal" is  different depending  on the country.

# Heat Content, Sulfur, Carbon.

+ Heat content, kJ/kg or  BTU/lb in merican, varies a little bit within category.  
    + 1 BTU = 1.055 kJ
    + 1 BTU is enough to raises one lb of water 1 F.
    + EIA swaps from BTU/ton to BTU/lb frequently.  
    + (short) ton = 2000 lbs
+ Sulfer can vary widely but except for lignite is less than 1%.  This is a polutant.
+ Carbon content virtually defines the ranks.

# The Numbers

Type    | Carbon%   |BTU/ton    |
-----   |-----      |-----      |
Lignite |30%        |10K -15K   |
Sub-Bituminous|40%  |16K -20K   |
Bituminous| 50%-70% |22K -30K   |
Anthracite| 90%+    | 28K+      |


# Where do you find it in the US?

# Where is it mined?

# Underground Fires

+ Coal fires are a thing.  The most famous US fire is Centralia, which started in 1962.
+ The most famous world wide is Mt Wingen in  New South Wales, which has been buring for 6,000 years.
+ There are a few thousand burning at any given moment.
    + Besides CO2 and SOX
    + Mercury

# How is it transported?

# Why coal?

Historical point of view:
+ Coal burns hotter than wood, but so does charcoal.
+ Coal (anthrocite) burns with less ash and smoke than wood, but so does charcoal.
+ Charcoal requires a lot of wood to make.
