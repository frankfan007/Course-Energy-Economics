## What Makes Electricity Interesting

+ We somehow start with a fuel (Counting wind, geothermal and sunlight in this).
+ Transport it from where we found it to a generating facility.
+ Turn it into electricity losing some energy as heat.
+ Run it along long wires to where people want to use it, losing yet more energy.
+ From there send it out to every small location (losing more), and
+ Because electricity is not _easily_ stored, adjust the rate at which we generate electricity moment-by-moment to make sure there is just enough.

This is a logistical miracle.


## Basic Units

+  $Watts = Amps Volts$ first thing everyone learns.
    + Pro tip on units, if it is someones name, capitalize it.
    + Volt is analogous to height.
    + Amp is analogous to a weight.
    + Watt is what it happens when that weight is dropped from that height.
    + DC is easy; AC is "complex"
+ AC because it is a wave, has a few more components.
    + Real Power, measured in W, it is what does the work.
    + Reactive power, measured in volt-amps (var),"r" tells you it is reactive, is what pushes the electricity around.
    + Apparent Power, is in volt-amps too (VA) is when you add the two together in a vector sense.
    + Power Factor is the Real(W)/Apparent(VA), the sign is interesting because assumes induction.

## What?

Caveat IANAE and I will do thing like call current amps and the like. Also, this is the simple, single phase, view with lots of simplifications. Reality is for engineers.

+ The alternating part of AC is what causes the complication.
    + You can talk about instantaneous power but
    + Tend to talk about average power.

+ With a resistive load, think light bulb, amps and volts are in sync
+ Inductors and Capacitors throw amps and volts out of sync
    + Capacitors store energy in electric fields. Think a very burst battery.
        + Amps peak _before_ volts
    + Inductors store energy in magnetic fields. Think about an electromagnet in a motor.
        + Amps peak _after_ volts

## Picture for this

## Power Factor

+ Measure it
    + Henrys are the unit for inductance/capacitance and engineers use that in calculations
    + There are also power factor meters
    + You can also check out the difference between amps and volt on oscilloscope.

+ Low numbers mean the utility needs to generate more power than customer uses.
    + Can happen with low load, like a motor barely moving, but you still need the electromagnet
    + Common solution is to install capacitors somewhere to cancel out the inductor

## Why do we care about reactive power and power factors?

+ Engineers have to design systems to accommodate not just the real, but real plus reactive, i.e., apparent power.
+ Reactive power has to be generated.
+ Not residential tariffs, but commercial and industrial tariffs charge for reactive power or have penalties for low power factors.

## kW vs kWh

+ kW is instantaneous and called power
+ kWh is the integral over time and called energy.

+ 100 W light bulb uses 100 Wh = 1/10 kWh per hour

+ Get used to flipping between 1,000,000,000 W =  1,000,000 kW = 1,000 MW = 1 GW

## Lets Generate Some Electricity

+ Turbine -- spin something in a magnetic field to induce a current.
+ Lots of ways to spin a turbine
    + Coal, grind it up, burn it, make steam, use steam to spin the turbine.
    + Nuclear, use the heat to make steam, use steam to spin a turbine.
    + Biomass, burn stuff to ...
    + Gas, burn it to spin a turbine ...
    + Fuel Oil or Diesel
    + Solar thermal, use the sun to make steam ...
    + Water, falling water hits a turbine and spins it
    + Wind, spin a turbine
    + etc.

+ Or don't spin a turbine and go for photo-voltaic, PV.

## Characteristics

+ Nameplate, fully loaded under ideal conditions (MW)
+ Ramp rate, how fast power (MW) can change MW/min
    + Not always constant, can differ by capacity factor (fraction of nameplate)
    + Not always symmetric, up different from down.
    + Used to follow the load.
+ Heat rate, BTU in/ BTU out, only used for generation that uses a fuel.
    + 1 is impossible but 1 kW = 3412 BTU.
    + Recent average from EIA, https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html

## Coal from the outside

## Coal on the inside

+ Pulverize the coal, picture something that can do 20 Tons/hr
+ Blow it into combustion chamber to burn
+ Steam turns turbine, etc. https://youtu.be/IdPTuwKEfmA

+ Clean up
    + NOx with ammonia common but plenty of others
    + Recover fly ash and sell it, great for concrete.
    + SOx, Mercury and other.  BTW Radiation

## Nuclear

Radiation to heat water and then ...similar to coal.  Just a reaction chamber

![](http://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/inside_core.jpg?11abca)

## Local Reactor Columbia Generating Station


+ 1,170 MW usually runs as load following.  It reacts fast enough.
    + France is ~70% nuclear and they load follow.
+ Most nuclear is run as base load, i.e., all the time since low variable cost and high fixed cost.
+ Palo Verde (AZ) is larger 3.3GW

## So, about nuclear

+ So what to do with spent fuel.
+ They probably produce less radiation than coal
+ Can produce cheap, in the marginal cost sense, power.  More on this later.

## Natural Gas Conventional and Combined Cycle

+ Combined cycle means
    + Taking more than one pass at extracting energy.
    + Spin the turbines first.
    + Take the heat and run a steam turbine.
    + Take the remaining heat and use a different working fluid (with different phase change properties) to extract more.

+ CCNG
    + Plants are more expensive
    + Have higher heat rates
+ Conventional
    + Cheap
    + Commonly run as peaking units.

## Biomass

+ Tend to be combined heat and power. Another way of using waste heat.
    + Cogeneration like this is common.
    + We have steam and chill water systems on campus 
+ While renewable, it is not, in general, clean
    + Particulates
    + Heavy metal concentration
    + etc.
+ All this is improving.

## Biomas One in Eugene. 30 MW and keeps catching on fire.

## Geothermal

+ Drill a hole down to where the temperature is high enough.
    + If it is dry, add water to make steam.
    + If wet, get steam
    + If temp is not high enough, use a few working fluids to generate electricity.

+ Run through a turbine.

## Neal Hot Spring in Malheur. 30 MW

![](http://geo-energy.org/images/plants/Aidlin.jpg)

## Diesel and other Fuel Oils

+ You know the drill ...
+ Less than 1\% in the US for electricity generation.
    + Still common heating fuel.
    + Backup fuel for NG generation
    + May be used in small distributed generation
+ More common in less developed countries

## Solar Thermal

+ You have see the low and mid temperature designs for heating and cooling.
+ High temperature designs are:
    + Dish
    + Tower
    + Trough

+ Fluids:
    + Oil
    + Salt
    + Water steam
+ Low and mid temperature are similar to roof top residential that you have seen.

## Hydro

So, you spin a turbine

![](http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/hydro%20copy.png)


## Hydro can be complex

+ Many constraints
    + Intra and interseason storage requirements
    + Temperature and turbidity constraints
    + Treaties and contracts
    + Minimum and maximum flow constraints
    + Dredging
    + Water quality
    

+ Can you go all hydro?
    + US ~6\% 
    + Norway ~95\%

## Everything Comes with a cost

## Wind

+ You find a good wind resource NREL Class 3 and up (http://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind_detail.html)
+ Put up a suitably rated 1.5MW windmill. 8MW is the largest I've hear about.
+ Maintain them, upgrade them and if need be demo them.

+ What people complain about
    + Noise -- Can't hear after a mile or two
    + Raptor and bat kills -- Less now with larger slower moving designs.
    + Ugly -- In in the eye of the beholder.

## PV

+ Does not spin a turbine.
+ PV effect generates DC electricity which is then converted to AC though an inverter

## Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Levelized Cost of Avoided Electricity (LACE)

+ https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/archive/aeo15/pdf/electricity_generation_2015.pdf Table 1
    + CC is Carbon Capture.
    + CCS is Carbon Capture and Storage
    
## Economics and History

+ Remember that material on transaction cost economics?
    + Induces firms to generate, transport (Transmission) and distribute electricity.
    + Very strong pressure to vertically integrate.
+ Large economies of scale produce natural monopolies
    + Declining marginal and average cost of production.
    + Potential duplicative capital expenditures reinforce this.
        + Imagine three power companies with separate poles and connections to your house.
        + Imagine all three of them with transmission lines from UT where they generate power.
    + We tend to regulate these in some way, limiting profit.
    
+ Warnings: 
    + Very simple view.  
    + With more than one price there are an infinite number of solutions to this problem.
    + Each parameter has a lot of uncertainty.
    + ROR is used in more than just energy.

## What Problems are there with Natural Monopolies

+ As with all firms  with monopoly power:
    + Output is reduced from socially optimal, to increase prices.
    + Dead weight loss from less than socially optimal production.
    + Transfer of surplus from buyers to sellers (Which often shows as super normal profit).

+ What makes them special is:
    + Socially optimal output, MC = D, implies negative economic profit.
    

## The Goals of Regulation

+ Profits should be normal, same as else where in the market with the same risk.
+ Output should at socially optimal, MC = D, not private profit maximizing, MC = MR.
+ There should be incentives to produce at lowest cost within each time period.
+ There should be incentives to reduce costs from one time period to the next, through R&D, capital investments and technology improvements.

## The goals of deregulation

+ The goal was not to not regulate.  The goal was to only regulate what you must.
    + Control of transmission was stifling cost reductions through competition.
+ Don't take the vertically integrated structure, which was dictated by transaction costs as a given.
    + FERC 888/889/2000 split the generation, transmission and distribution parts.
    + ISO/RTO, mostly non-profits set up markets and perform tasks relating to transmission.
    + If you are not in an ISO/RTO you still have to split out generation from transmission.  State law does this.
    
## What does an ISO/RTO do.

+ Air traffic controllers for transmission.  The direct it, plan for expansion, set open prices, pay the people that own it, set prices to avoid congestion.
+ Make sure people can see the prices for transmission, OASIS
+ Organize wholesale markets.  Usually day ahead and real time, hour ahead.
+ Markets for grid stability services: Regulation up/down, spinning, non-spinning, black start
+ Meet NERC, and regional reliability requirements
+ Make sure that no one is manipulating the markets and fix the rules so they can't

## Rate of Return Regulation

ROR requires normal economic profits but is often visualized in many different ways.

+ Setting P=AC
    + In a one price context this sets AR=AC and gives zero economic profit.
    + Increases output from MR=MC to AR=AC but not all the way to efficient MC=D.


## ROR Math for fixed price

\begin{align}
\max\limits_{k,l} & p f(k,l) - wl - rk \\
& s.t. \frac{p f(k,l) - wl}{k} \leq b
\end{align}

+ Variables:
    + k and l are capital and labor
    + f is production function
    + p is output price
    + w and r are wage and rental rate
    + b is the required rate of return

Sub in $p(f(k,l))$ for monopoly.

You probably want diagrams for this.

## Questions for Wednesday

1. Start with a natural monopoly, i.e., when average cost and MC are ever decreasing.  Show DWL, CS and PS when this firm profit maximizes.

2. Again start with a natural monopoly.  Show DWL, CS and PS when this firm is subject to AC price regulation.

3. Take a look at figure 1 in the original paper on the Averch - Johnson effect ( http://stats.lib.pdx.edu/proxy.php?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812181?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).  Ignore most of the math unless you are into it.  Explain what is the A-J effect and why it happens with the simple isoquant-iso cost diagram. Explaining why ray 2 is where it is and why is the hard part.

## What a Natural Monopoly Looks Like in Q-Cost Space

## What Rate of Return Regulation Looks like in Q-Cost Space

## Sounds simple but

+ How do you know those costs?  They may not be known ahead of time.  They could be random.
+ There is more than one price for electricity and different prices for different customers.
+ Rate setting is a periodic judicial process most often using retrospective cost data but also using forecasts.

## "Revenue Requirement"

$$RR  = v(q) + b RB$$

+ Note variable change from above.  
+ The revenue requirement (RR) must be satisfied by the pricing system.      
    + Why the simple versions with a single price is P = AC.
    + No guidance on what to do when there is more than one price, except find a way to allocate costs to those prices.

+ Most commonly the RR:
    + Passes variable costs, v(q), like fuel and wages though to be included in prices.
    + Has a target return on capital, b, which is known to attract capital and compensate investors for risks.
    + That rate of return is applied to the Rate Base, RB, which is analogous to capital.

## "Cost" is much more complex than that

+ We don't put a price on every service to the end user.
+ We often pay for one service, like transmission, by lumping it in with a different service, say energy kWh.
+ We also will use average values of cost and give one price to everyone, like residential kWh.
    + The cost at peak is higher than middle of the night.
    + The cost in rural areas is higher than urban
+ Other objectives that make it so cost and price don't align.
    + Less expensive to poor
    + Incentivize conservation
    + Cognitive limitations

## Pictures with lots of cost drivers 

+ One House (Certainty Costs):
    + Connection: Just having access is a service
    + Demand Charge kW: How much you use at most determines the fixed cost of local distribution
    + Coincident Peak $kW_c$: How much you consume at system peak.  Your contribution to the fixed and sunk cost of transmission and generation.
    + Energy Use kW:  Many choices here, do you average all the costs, integrate individually?

+ System (Randomness Costs):
    + The random squiggles (high frequency noise): Regulation
        + Do you charge for individual variation or based on the incremental effect
    + Larger movements (Lower and Lower still frequency noise): Spinning and non-spinning reserve.
    + Black Start (How to start after blackout)
    + Maintenance and monitoring: SCADA, tree trimming, down lines, etc.

## What do ROR incentives do?

+ If I can pass all variable costs on to the customer ...
    + Regulatory Accounting Standards just like GAAP and GASB.
    + Regulators scrutinize and decide if an expenditure is allowable expenditure, in the rate base, or shareholder responsibility.
    
+ Flip side, if I make investments or go through the effort to reduce costs, the savings don't result in more profit
    + You only see the cost and risk.
    + The customer sees only the benefits.

+ Not bad if there are long periods between rate changes.
    + If you reduce costs you see the benefits between rate changes.
    + If your costs are high, you eat the costs between rate changes.
    
Terrible cost savings incentives.
    
## How else can I increase profits?

+ Add more things to the rate base.  
+ This is the A-J effect.
    + Firms prefer to deliver services by investing in capital.
    + The rate of return, b, does not increase but if you increase RB your revenue increases and your profit, i.e., net income increases.
    + Why Demand Side Management had an initial battle:
        + Rate payer advocates wanted it to pass through as expense.
        + Shareholders wanted it counted just like a power plant, in the rate base.
        
## What ROR Regulation looks like in Input-Output Space.



## What about b?

  + b is actually more than one number.
  + Bond rate necessary to attract lending.
  + Return on common equity to attract shareholders
  + There could be others.

## Yardstick Regulation

Yardstick competition (Shliefer 1985) http://stats.lib.pdx.edu/proxy.php?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2555560.  Don't use the firm's own costs, use the costs of an identical firm elsewhere.

+ Creates cost competition where none previously existed.
    + If you reduce costs and your yardstick matches do not, you get higher profits.
    + If you reduce your cost of capital and your yardstick matches do not, you get higher profits.
    
+ The usual worries
    + Benefits to colluding
    + Odd scale effects and competitor shopping
    + Mergers
        + Merging with your yardstick competitor may be a very good thing.
        + Mergers or reverse may be motivated the yardstick competitors.

## CPI-X or Price Cap    

CPI-X.  Prices increase periodically year by CPI less some amount X.  X is chosen as an average rate of cost savings.

+ Incentives to reduce costs
    + If you reduce costs faster than X, you get to keep it.
    + No reference to another firm.

+ But ...
    + Where did you get X?
    + How do you know costs will on average go down?
