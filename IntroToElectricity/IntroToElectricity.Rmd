## What Make Electricity Interesting

+ We somehow start with a fuel (Counting wind, geothermal and sunlight in this).
+ Transport it from where we found it to a generating facility.
+ Turn it into electricity losing some energy as heat.
+ Run it along long wires to where people want to use it, losing yet more energy.
+ From there send it out to every small location (losing more), and
+ Because electricity is not _easily_ stored, adjust the rate at which we generate electricity moment-by-moment to make sure there is just enough.

This is a logistical miracle.

## Basic Units

+  $Watts = Amps Volts$ first thing everyone learns. 
    + Pro tip on units, if it is someones name, capitalize it.
    + Volt is analogous to height.  
    + Amp is analogous to a weight.
    + Watt is what it happens when that weight is dropped from that height.
    + DC is easy; AC is "complex"
+ AC because it is a wave, has a few more components.
    + Real Power, measured in W, it is what does the work.
    + Reactive power, measured in volt-amps (var),"r" tells you it is reactive, is what pushes the electricity around.
    + Apparent Power, is in volt-amps too (VA) is when you add the two together in a vector sense.
    + Power Factor is the Real(W)/Apparant(VA), the sign is interesting because assumes induction.
    
## What?

Caveat IANAE and I will do thing like call current amps and the like. Also, this is the simple, single phase, view with lots of simplifications. Reality is for engineers. 

+ The alternating part of AC is what causes the complication.
    + You can talk about instantaneous power but
    + Tend to talk about average power.
    
+ With a resistive load, think light bulb, amps and volts are in sync
+ Inductors and Capacitors throw amps and volts out of sync
    + Capacitors store energy in electric fields. Think a very bursty battery.
        + Amps peak _before_ volts
    + Inductors store energy in magnetic fields. Think about an electromagnet in a motor.
        + Amps peak _after_ volts

## Power Factor

+ Measure it
    + Henrys are the unit for inductance/capacitance and engineers use that in calculations
    + There are also power factor meters
    + You can also check out the difference between amps and volt on ocilliscope.

+ Low numbers mean the utility needs to generate more power than customer uses.
    + Can happen with low load, like a motor barely moving, but you still need the electromagnet
    + Common solution is to install capacitors somewhere to cancel out the inductor

## Why do we care about reactive power and power factors?

+ Engineers have to design systems to accomodate not just the real, but real plus reactive, i.e., apparant power.
+ Reactive power has to be generated.
+ Not residential tariffs, but commercial and industrial tariffs charge for reactive power or have penalties for low power factors.

## kW vs kWh

+ kW is instantanious and called power
+ kWh is the integral over time and called energy.

+ 100 W light bulb uses 100 Wh = 1/10 kWh per hour

## Lets Generate Some Electricity

+ Turbine -- spin something in a magnetic field to induce a current.
+ Lots of ways to spin a turbine
    + Coal, grind it up, burn it, make steam, use steam to spin the turbine.
    + Nuclear, use the heat to make steam, use steam to spin a turbine.
    + Biomas, burn stuff to ...
    + Gas, burn it to spin a turbine ...
    + Diesel
    + Oil
    + Solar thermal, use the sun to make steam ...
    + Water, falling water hits a turbine and spins it
    + Wind, spin a turbine
    + etc.
    
+ Or don't spin a turbine and go for photovoltaic, PV.

## Characteristics

+ Ramp rate, how fast power (kW) can change kW/min
+ Heat rate, BTU in/ BTU out, only used for generation that uses a fuel
