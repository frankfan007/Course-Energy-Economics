## What Makes Electricity Interesting

+ We somehow start with a fuel (Counting wind, geothermal and sunlight in this).
+ Transport it from where we found it to a generating facility.
+ Turn it into electricity losing some energy as heat.
+ Run it along long wires to where people want to use it, losing yet more energy.
+ From there send it out to every small location (losing more), and
+ Because electricity is not _easily_ stored, adjust the rate at which we generate electricity moment-by-moment to make sure there is just enough.

This is a logistical miracle.


## Basic Units

+  $Watts = Amps Volts$ first thing everyone learns.
    + Pro tip on units, if it is someones name, capitalize it.
    + Volt is analogous to height.
    + Amp is analogous to a weight.
    + Watt is what it happens when that weight is dropped from that height.
    + DC is easy; AC is "complex"
+ AC because it is a wave, has a few more components.
    + Real Power, measured in W, it is what does the work.
    + Reactive power, measured in volt-amps (var),"r" tells you it is reactive, is what pushes the electricity around.
    + Apparent Power, is in volt-amps too (VA) is when you add the two together in a vector sense.
    + Power Factor is the Real(W)/Apparant(VA), the sign is interesting because assumes induction.

## What?

Caveat IANAE and I will do thing like call current amps and the like. Also, this is the simple, single phase, view with lots of simplifications. Reality is for engineers.

+ The alternating part of AC is what causes the complication.
    + You can talk about instantaneous power but
    + Tend to talk about average power.

+ With a resistive load, think light bulb, amps and volts are in sync
+ Inductors and Capacitors throw amps and volts out of sync
    + Capacitors store energy in electric fields. Think a very bursty battery.
        + Amps peak _before_ volts
    + Inductors store energy in magnetic fields. Think about an electromagnet in a motor.
        + Amps peak _after_ volts

## Picture for this

## Power Factor

+ Measure it
    + Henrys are the unit for inductance/capacitance and engineers use that in calculations
    + There are also power factor meters
    + You can also check out the difference between amps and volt on ocilliscope.

+ Low numbers mean the utility needs to generate more power than customer uses.
    + Can happen with low load, like a motor barely moving, but you still need the electromagnet
    + Common solution is to install capacitors somewhere to cancel out the inductor

## Why do we care about reactive power and power factors?

+ Engineers have to design systems to accomodate not just the real, but real plus reactive, i.e., apparant power.
+ Reactive power has to be generated.
+ Not residential tariffs, but commercial and industrial tariffs charge for reactive power or have penalties for low power factors.

## kW vs kWh

+ kW is instantanious and called power
+ kWh is the integral over time and called energy.

+ 100 W light bulb uses 100 Wh = 1/10 kWh per hour

+ Get used to flipping between 1,000,000,000 W =  1,000,000 kW = 1,000 MW = 1 GW

## Lets Generate Some Electricity

+ Turbine -- spin something in a magnetic field to induce a current.
+ Lots of ways to spin a turbine
    + Coal, grind it up, burn it, make steam, use steam to spin the turbine.
    + Nuclear, use the heat to make steam, use steam to spin a turbine.
    + Biomas, burn stuff to ...
    + Gas, burn it to spin a turbine ...
    + Fuel Oil or Diesel
    + Solar thermal, use the sun to make steam ...
    + Water, falling water hits a turbine and spins it
    + Wind, spin a turbine
    + etc.

+ Or don't spin a turbine and go for photovoltaic, PV.

## Characteristics

+ Nameplate, fully loaded under ideal conditions (MW)
+ Ramp rate, how fast power (MW) can change MW/min
    + Not always constant, can differ by capacity factor (fraction of nameplate)
    + Not always symetric, up different from down.
    + Used to follow the load.
+ Heat rate, BTU in/ BTU out, only used for generation that uses a fuel.
    + 1 is impossible but 1 kW = 3412 BTU.
    + Recent average from EIA, https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html

## Coal from the outside

## Coal on the inside

+ Pulverize the coal, picture somethign that can do 20 Tons/hr
+ Blow it into combustion chamber to burn
+ Steam turns turbine, etc. https://youtu.be/IdPTuwKEfmA

+ Clean up
    + NOx with ammonia common but plenty of others
    + Recover fly ash and sell it, great for concrete.
    + SOx, Mercury and other.  BTW Radiation

## Nuclear

Radiation to heat water and then ...similar to coal.  Just a reaction chamber

![](http://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/inside_core.jpg?11abca)

## Local Reactor Columbia Generating Station


+ 1,170 MW usually runs as load following.  It reacts fast enough.
    + France is ~70% nuclear and they load follow.
+ Most nuclear is run as base load, i.e., all the time since low variable cost and high fixed cost.
+ Palo Verde (AZ) is larger 3.3GW

## So, about nuclear

+ So what to do with spent fuel.
+ They probably produce less radiation than coal
+ Can produce cheap, in the marginal cost sense, power.  More on this later.

## Natural Gas Conventional and Combined Cycle

+ Combined cycle means
    + Taking mored than one pass at extracting energy.
    + Spin the turbines first.
    + Take the heat and run a steam turbine.
    + Take the remaining heat and use a different working fluid (with different phase change properties) to extract more.

+ CCNG
    + Plants are more expensive
    + Have higher heat rates
+ Conventional
    + Cheap
    + Commonly run as peaking units.

## Biomass

+ Tend to be combined heat and power. Another way of using waste heat.
    + Cogeneration like this is common.
    + We have steam and chill water systems on campus 
+ While renewable, it is not, in general, clean
    + Particulates
    + Heavy metal concentration
    + etc.
+ All this is improveing.

## Biomas One in Eugene. 30 MW and keeps catching on fire.

## Geothermal

+ Drill a hole down to where the temperature is high enough.
    + If it is dry, add water to make steam.
    + If wet, get steam
    + If temp is not high enough, use a few working fluids to generate electricity.

+ Run through a turbine.

## Neal Hot Spring in Malheur. 30 MW

![](http://geo-energy.org/images/plants/Aidlin.jpg)

## Diesel and other Fuel Oils

+ You know the drill ...
+ Less than 1\% in the US for electricity generation.
    + Still common heating fuel.
    + Backup fuel for NG generation
    + May be used in small distributed generation
+ More common in less developed countries

## Solar Thermal

+ You have see the low and mid temperature designs for heating and cooling.
+ High temperature designs are:
    + Dish
    + Tower
    + Trough

+ Fluids:
    + Oil
    + Salt
    + Water steam
+ Low and mid temperature are similar to roof top residential that you have seen.

## Hydro

So, you spin a turbine

![](http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/hydro%20copy.png)


## Hydro can be complex

+ Many constraints
    + Intra and interseason storage requirements
    + Temperature and turbidity constraints
    + Treaties and contracts
    + Minimum and maximum flow constraints
    + Dredging
    + Water quality
    

+ Can you go all hydro?
    + US ~6\% 
    + Norway ~95\%

## Everything Comes with a cost

## Wind

+ You find a good wind resource NREL Class 3 and up (http://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind_detail.html)
+ Put up a suitably rated 1.5MW windmill. 8MW is the largest I've hear about.
+ Maintain them, upgrade them and if need be demo them.

+ What people complain about
    + Noise -- Can't hear after a mile or two
    + Raptor and bat kills -- Less now with larger slower moving designs.
    + Ugly -- In in the eye of the beholder.

## PV

+ Does not spin a turbine.
+ PV effect generates DC electricity which is then converted to AC though an inverter

## Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)

+ https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/archive/aeo15/pdf/electricity_generation_2015.pdf Table 1
    + CC is Carbon Capture.
    + CCS is Carbon Capture and Storage
    
## Economics and History

+ Remember that material on transaction cost economics?
    + Induces firms to generate, transport (Transmission) and distribute electricity.
    + Very strong pressure to vertically integrate.
+ Large economies of scale produce natural monopolies
    + Declining marginal and average cost of production.
    + Potential duplicative capital expenditures reinforce this.
        + Imagine three power companies with separate poles and connections to your house.
        + Imagine all three of them with transmission lines from UT where they generate power.
    + We tend to regulate these in some way, limiting profit.
    
    



## Question 1

Start with a natural monopoly, i.e., when average cost and MC are ever decreasing.  Show DWL, CS and PS when this firm profit maximizes.

## Question 2

Again start with a natural monopoly.  Show DWl, CS and PS when this firm is subject to AC price regulation.

## Question 3

Take a look at figure 1 in the original paper on the Averch - Johnson effect ( http://stats.lib.pdx.edu/proxy.php?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812181?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).  Ignore most of the math unless you are into it.  Explain what is the A-J effect and why it happens with the simple isoquant-iso cost diagram.
