## What Make Electricity Interesting

+ We somehow start with a fuel (Counting wind, geothermal and sunlight in this).
+ Transport it from where we found it to a generating facility.
+ Turn it into electricity losing some energy as heat.
+ Run it along long wires to where people want to use it, losing yet more energy.
+ From there send it out to every small location (losing more), and
+ Because electricity is not _easily_ stored, adjust the rate at which we generate electricity moment-by-moment to make sure there is just enough.

This is a logistical miracle.

## Basic Units

+  $Watts = Amps Volts$ first thing everyone learns. 
    + Pro tip on units, if it is someones name, capitalize it.
    + Volt is analogous to height.  
    + Amp is analogous to a weight.
    + Watt is what it happens when that weight is dropped from that height.
    + DC is easy; AC is "complex"
+ AC because it is a wave, has a few more components.
    + Real Power, measured in W, it is what does the work.
    + Reactive power, measured in volt-amps (var),"r" tells you it is reactive, is what pushes the electricity around.
    + Apparent Power, is in volt-amps too (VA) is when you add the two together in a vector sense.
    + Power Factor is the Real(W)/Apparant(VA), the sign is interesting because assumes induction.
    
## What?

Caveat IANAE and I will do thing like call current amps and the like. Also, this is the simple, single phase, view with lots of simplifications. Reality is for engineers. 

+ The alternating part of AC is what causes the complication.
    + You can talk about instantaneous power but
    + Tend to talk about average power.
    
+ With a resistive load, think light bulb, amps and volts are in sync
+ Inductors and Capacitors throw amps and volts out of sync
    + Capacitors store energy in electric fields. Think a very bursty battery.
        + Amps peak _before_ volts
    + Inductors store energy in magnetic fields. Think about an electromagnet in a motor.
        + Amps peak _after_ volts

## Power Factor

+ Measure it
    + Henrys are the unit for inductance/capacitance and engineers use that in calculations
    + There are also power factor meters
    + You can also check out the difference between amps and volt on ocilliscope.

+ Low numbers mean the utility needs to generate more power than customer uses.
    + Can happen with low load, like a motor barely moving, but you still need the electromagnet
    + Common solution is to install capacitors somewhere to cancel out the inductor

## Why do we care about reactive power and power factors?

+ Engineers have to design systems to accomodate not just the real, but real plus reactive, i.e., apparant power.
+ Reactive power has to be generated.
+ Not residential tariffs, but commercial and industrial tariffs charge for reactive power or have penalties for low power factors.

## kW vs kWh

+ kW is instantanious and called power
+ kWh is the integral over time and called energy.

+ 100 W light bulb uses 100 Wh = 1/10 kWh per hour

## Lets Generate Some Electricity

+ Turbine -- spin something in a magnetic field to induce a current.
+ Lots of ways to spin a turbine
    + Coal, grind it up, burn it, make steam, use steam to spin the turbine.
    + Nuclear, use the heat to make steam, use steam to spin a turbine.
    + Biomas, burn stuff to ...
    + Gas, burn it to spin a turbine ...
    + Fuel Oil or Diesel
    + Solar thermal, use the sun to make steam ...
    + Water, falling water hits a turbine and spins it
    + Wind, spin a turbine
    + etc.
    
+ Or don't spin a turbine and go for photovoltaic, PV.

## Characteristics

+ Nameplate, fully loaded under ideal conditions (kW)
+ Ramp rate, how fast power (kW) can change kW/min
    + Not always constant, can differ by capacity factor (fraction of nameplate)
    + Not always symetric, up different from down.
    + Used to follow the load.
+ Heat rate, BTU in/ BTU out, only used for generation that uses a fuel.
    + 1 is impossible but 1 kW = 3412 BTU.
    + Recent average from EIA, https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_01.html
    
## Coal from the outside

## Coal on the inside

+ Pulverize the coal, picture somethign that can do 20 Tons/hr
+ Blow it into combustion chamber to burn
+ Steam turns turbine, etc. https://youtu.be/IdPTuwKEfmA

+ Clean up
    + NOx with ammonia common but plenty of others
    + Recover fly ash and sell it, great for concrete.
    + SOx, Mercury and other.  BTW Radiation
    
## Nuclear

Radiation to heat water and then ...similar to coal.  Just a reaction chamber

## Local Reactor Columbia Generating Station

+ http://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/inside_core.jpg?11abca
+ 1,170 MW usually runs as load following.  It reacts fast enough.
    + France is ~70% nuclear and they load follow.
+ Most nuclear is run as base load, i.e., all the time since low variable cost and high fixed cost.
+ Palo Verde (AZ) is larger 3.3GW

## So, about nuclear

+ So what to do with spent fuel.
+ They probably produce less radiation than coal
+ Can produce cheap power.  More on this later.

## Natural Gas Conventional and Combined Cycle

## Biomass

## Biomas One in Eugene. 30 MW and keeps catching on fire.

## Geothermal

## Neal Hot Spring in Malheur. 30 MW

## Diesel and other Fuel Oils

## Solar Thermal

+ You have see the low and mid temperature designs for heating and cooling.
+ High temperature designs are:
    + Dish
    + Tower
    + Trough

    + Salt 
    + Water steam
