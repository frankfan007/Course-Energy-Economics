# Discussion of

Couture, Toby, and Yves Gagnon. "An analysis of feed-in tariff remuneration models: Implications for renewable energy investment." Energy policy 38.2 (2010): 955-965

# Main Points

+ Discussion of Feed In tariffs.  
+ This is a way of compensating types of generation you want to encourage.
+ Other Alternatives:
    + Net Metering (Small Scale)
    + Renewable Portfolio Standards (Utility Scale)
    + Power Purchase Agreement (General Term)
+ Implicit is mandatory purchase of generated power.

# Net Metering

Visualize a rooftop PV system.

+ You generate electricity
+ If you use more than you generate only get charged for the excess.
+ If you generate more than you use, the excess is subtracted from your bill at the rate you are charged.
+ Most people don't use power (evening) when they generate it (day).

# Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)

Standard for a utility to have x% of generation come from renewable sources.

+ Premium for renewable and minimum standards achieve same result.
+ RPS hides the cost while the premium makes it specific.

# Simple Static Calc 4 example

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{b,g} & f(b) + n(g)\\
s.t. & b + g = L
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

+ b = brown electricity
+ g = green electricity
+ f and n = cost of generating brown and  green energy.
+ L = amount you need.

# With RPS

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{b,g} && f(b) + n(g)\\
s.t. && b + g = L\\
      && \frac{g}{b+g} \geq R
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

+ R is required fraction that is green.

+ RPS is a constraint

# With Feed-In Tarfiff

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{b,g} && f(b) + n(g) - r g\\
s.t. && b + g = L
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

+ Subsidized Feed-In tariffs lowers net cost  of producing green energy.
+ r is the per unit subsidy
+ There is always a feed-in tariff that give you your desired proportion of green energy, R, and vice-versa. 

# Key Considerations in Feed-in tariff

+ Uncertainty nominal price
+ Uncertainty real price
+ Variability in profit
+ Incentives to invest in cost minimizing way.

# Fixed Price

# Fixed Price

+ Uncertainty nominal price: Known with certainty
+ Uncertainty real price: Inflation is unknown
+ Variability in profit:  Future costs are unknown
+ Incentives to invest in cost minimizing way: Very hard to pick the right price.  Once established, strong incentives to reduce operating costs.


# Fixed Price with Inflation

# Fixed Price with Inflation

+ Uncertainty nominal price: Known with certainty in next time period.
+ Uncertainty real price: Inflation included in price. (Note that is commonly lagged inflation.)
+ Variability in profit:  Future costs are unknown.
+ Incentives to invest in cost minimizing way: Very hard to pick the right price.  Once established, strong incentives to reduce operating costs.


# Front Loaded

# Front Loaded

+ Uncertainty nominal price: Known with certainty
+ Uncertainty real price: Inflation is unknown
+ Variability in profit:  Future costs are unknown but if costs are inversely correlated with time, reduces uncertainty.
+ Incentives to invest in cost minimizing way: ?

This better tracks the cost pattern, more tax depreciation in early years, 

# Spot Market Plus

# Spot Market Plus

+ Uncertainty nominal price: Cuts off the downside
+ Uncertainty real price: Similar but does not adjust the floor with inflation.
+ Variability in profit:  Reduced uncertainty and allows firms to capture profits when prices are high.
+ Incentives to invest in cost minimizing way: ?

Given that the generator is in an ISO, wholesale markets that are easy to access,  this provides strong incentives to invest.


# Premium Price
![](PremPriceFIT.PNG)

#  Premium Price

+ Same uncertainty in price and profit as market exposure
+ Higher average prices and  profits

# Variable Premium
![](PremiumFIT.PNG)

# Variable Premium

+ Puts a lower and upper bound on the premium price subsidy.
 
# Percent Retail

# Percent Retail

+ Graph is funny but this is a multiplicative version of premium price.
