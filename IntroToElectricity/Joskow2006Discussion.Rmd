# Introduction

+ Mentions FERC 888, 889, 2000
+ The glow that faded from higher MC prices vs AC prices.
+ "Fragments of Evidence"?
    + Econ on big on making sure we describe causal effects, not just correlations.
    + We required control, or quasi-control groups for counterfactuals.
    
# Counterfactual

+ What would have happened in the absence of a treatment.
+ Example:
    + Randomized Control Trial (RCT)
    + Quasi-experimental controls
+ Hard to do with 50 states
    + Need stats that are very similar, one that chose deregulation and one that did not.
    + Those don't exist.
    + Or, a very good model (perfect) of why states chose to do what they do.
    
# Standard Market Design

NOPR in 2002 but withdrawn in 2005.  Many good ideas.

Check the reasons for the withdrawl in item 5.
