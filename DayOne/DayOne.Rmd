# Note on Class Slides

+ They are intended to go along with what I say, they are not a substitute.
+ I don't do pretty
+ I don't do fancy
+ There are always typos.

# Energy Economics

Economics and structure of energy markets, with a focus on electricity. Examines current policy issues arising from energy production and use.

+ We will be looking at energy markets specifically at the start of class but some of the more interesting topic are in the "consequences of production and use"
    + Is Fracking a "resource curse"?
    + Does development of wind resources have an effect on real estate prices?
+ The field has a mix of:
    + Powerful econometrics
    + Microeconomic theory
    
We will be tuning the class to your level of expertise and filling in the blanks as we go.

# Where I am coming from

+ Started in energy at the California Energy Commission back in the mid 90s.
    + Transportation energy use, choice, and simulation
    + Market transformation
    + Feebates
+ Energy efficiency evaluation
+ Conservation behavior

In short, I come from the consumption side, not the production side.

# Where can you take this knowledge

+ Energy Efficiency evaluation 
    + Plenty of local firms do this (Many former students)
    + Energy Trust (A few here)
+ Utilities
    + Northwest Natural 
    + PGE, Pacificorp
+ Government
    + Oregon department of energy
    + Many opportunities as Cap and Trade takes off
+ Other For Profit
    + Anything related to home automation.
    + Use off high frequency meter data.
+ Non-profit
    + Plenty but Carbon  Offset certification and evaluation is a growing industry.
    
# Warnings

+ I'm Dyslexic.  If you see a slide without a typo -- be amazed.
+ Don't think that you have to understand everything
    + You should read everything.
    + I unusually read things over and over again and learn new things every time.
    + If you understand half -- amazing.
    + The more you read, the easier it is to learn more.  It really builds on itself.
+ Don't be afraid to Google a picture or an article to help you understanding something in class.
    + You need to learn how to help yourself.
    + Learned helplessness is a pet peeve of  mine.
+ Do not wait till the last minute  
    + Don't make an optimistic, tightly scheduled plans.
    + No plan survives contact with reality
    + Start everything as early as possible.

# Look at Course Requirements and the Syllabus

A few things of note

+ There is a term paper and homework but no exam.
+ Presentations
+ My contention is that if you are good with theoretical models, empirical models or explaining them to others, you are employable.
    + The last one is frequently forgotten.
    + They are often the highest fliers in the industry.
+ I will be adding significant material on Cap and Trade
    + Workshops in the Oregon legislature are going on right now.
    + Prepping a bill for the 2018 session.

# Lets see where you are

Time to take the pre-test.

+ Does not count for your grade
+ Don't freak out if you can't do all of it.
+ You should be able to do at least one.
+ Just taking a class and getting an A does not mean you remember or can use the skills.

I'm trying to sort out how to dial in lecture and where I need to add skills.  

# Reading for Wednesday

Read Dahl Ch 1-2.  It is about 40 pages.

DON'T PANIC

# How to Read Academic Papers

It is a multipass system.

+ Read the Title and abstract (Papers)
+ Read the section headings
+ Read the introduction
+ Read the conclusion
+ Look at the figures
+ Look at the equations
+ Skim the whole thing
+ Read it but don't freak out if you don't get everything.
    + Keep notes on your reactions, how the topic connects back and questions (My personal notes on papers are filled with profanity)
    + Repeat as time allows.

You, and the author, will never fully understand the paper/chapter.

# Wednesday and Monday

+ There is a homework due on Monday.
+ Wednesday I will have a lecture on :
    + The last part of chapter 2 on modeling, i.e., the topic of the homework.
    + IV estimation an option on the homework.
+ We will reserve some time to peak at the papers you found for the Homework.
    + Hint: This is like a marshmallow test for procrastination.

# Monday's Homework

+ Take a look 
+ Pick a paper, the linked journals in the syllabus are a good source.
+ Pick something that interests you.
+ Make a bare bones presentation.  Don't get fancy
    + You can use a piece of paper on the overhead
    + You can chalk and talk with a handout
    + If you spend more time on formatting than content, you did it wrong.
