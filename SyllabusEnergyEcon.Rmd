# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

> Economics and structure of energy markets, with a focus on electricity. Examines current policy issues arising from energy production and use.


This is a companion course to EC 437/537 which will address regulatory and competitive policies in electricity, public transportation, water, natural,  and telecommunications.  The order of the courses has changed to reflect the evolving nature of the field.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has microeconomic theory, EC 311, or the calculus based version, EC 415, listed as prerequisites.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.

As with most economics courses, the more background you bring to the class, the more get from the class.  For this class, it means bringing a background in microeconomic theory and econometrics.  Not all students will have a background in both and many of the graduate students from outside of economics will have neither.  Any technical skills that students are missing will be supplemented with in-class tutorials.  Sometimes this will mean learning about constrained optimization or breaking out laptops for a tutorial on running regressions in R.

# Contact Information

<!-- Communication will be handled through slack https://psuenergyecon.slack.com. You should have received an invitation, if not, just go to that URL and use your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started. https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users -->

<!-- Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication.  It even handles phone calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels, e.g., #general. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message, i.e., @woodsj. The group has global do not disturb hours of 10pm - 8am.  If you would like something different, alter your personal settings. -->


<!-- Please note that I am not online all the time, and when I am online I will prioritize well-phrased questions with sufficient detail.  I tend to ignore general complaints, questions that can be answered by reading the syllabus or using the search bar.   -->


Office Hours:


+ There are no in-person office hours this term.  We will use Zoom to meet face to face. 
+ Drop in office hours are Monday 3-4pm and Tuesday 10am-11am through the last week of class. I will keep a Zoom meeting up during this time.
+ You can schedule one-on-one meetings at https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/.

# Textbook and Other Resources

The main text for the course is Dahl, Carol. _International Energy Markets: Understanding Pricing, Policies, & Profits._ PennWell Books, 2015.  It was chosen undergraduates in mind and illustrates many of the concepts they learned in EC 311/415. 

This text will be heavily supplemented with material from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the textbook authors website, and journal articles and other resources available electronically through the library.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

This class will be taught as a collaborative seminar with limited traditional lecture. There are no exams but there will be a considerable amount of writing and analysis and presentations. Nearly all work product will be made public to the class, though your grade will not.

+ Discussion and Assignments (in total): 45%
+ Final Draft of Term Paper: 20%
+ Draft Term Paper: 15%
+ Presentation of Paper Topic: 15%
+ Annotated Bibliography: 3%
+ Abstract: 2%


Term papers and bibliographies will be turned in online as a pdf or a link to a google doc with PSU log in and granted comment privileges.  Malfunctioning links or corrupted files will be interpreted as a missed deadline and receive half the normal credit if corrected within 24 hrs. If a deadline is missed by more than 24 hrs, zero credit will be given.  

## Discussion

Discussion will be facilitated by the instructor with the class being broken into semi-permanant teams who will be assigned specific questions about the readings.  These questions will often, but not always, be distributed to the class ahead of time.  

After discussion the teams will publish a summary of their conclusions to the rest of the class and answer questions from the class about the summary.

Teams will be assigned by the instructor during the first week of class. Assignments will be made based a survey of completed math, economics and statistics courses. The intent is to ensure that each team has the skills it needs to succeed.

A team may remove a member by an anonymous 3/4th majority vote of current members. Removed members will act as a team of one until other teams remove members or students join the class. Removed members may join other teams by an anonymous 3/4th majority vote of the receiving team. All votes will be conducted by the instructor. The instructor reserves the right to reassign students to teams should there be large differences in team size.

Teams are expected to create intuitive explanations, make critical statements, and field reasonable questions.  Performance will be evaluated by the instructor on a 0 to 5 scale.  Feedback from students in the form of Best and Worst group member will be collected at the end of the class meeting.

## Assignments

In class discussions are most effective when everyone has read the material before class.  In order to make this more likely there may be a small writing or problem solving  assignment associated with the readings.

These questions may be microeconomic theory questions, interpretations of graphs and regression output in papers, etc. They will not be duplicates of the questions we will discuss in class.

These will be due at the start of the class to avoid any confusion.



## Individual/Group Term Paper

The largest assignment will be a term paper. The term paper may be
either a literature review, in which case it _must_ be completed by an individual, or an empirical/theoretical
paper which may have up to three co-authors. Graduate students
must complete an empirical/theoretical paper. Term paper preparation and evaluation will be in stages.  

Key deadlines for the term paper are:

1. Draft Abstract: _October 16th at 5pm_.
1. 20-minute Abstract Review: _October 26th at 5pm_.
1. Revised Abstract: _October 28th at 5pm_. 
1. Annotated bibliography: _November 1st at 5pm_. 
1. 20-Minute Presentation: _November 13th_.
1. Draft Paper: _November 18th at 5 pm_. 
1. Final Paper: _December 6th at 5pm_. 

Term papers must be **less than 20 pages** excluding bibliography, but should be about 15 pages.  The submission must include a separate document addressing issues with the draft paper stating how the point is either irrelevant or how it is addressed in the paper.

# Topics and Readings

Do not let this section alarm you.  We will only address part of this outline in the class. As with most of my upper-division courses, we will complete a small subset at the start of the class and then vote on each succeeding topic. Each topic will have an assignment, usually working with real data or using a model from the readings.

Each topic has some readings that both undergraduates and graduate students will read and some that are specific to each. Note that some of these modules will be shared with the Public Utility Economics course and I will be adding optional topics and supplementary readings throughout the term.
