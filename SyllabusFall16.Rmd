# Course Description

The official description of the course is:
> Economics and structure of energy markets, with a focus on electricity. Examines current policy issues arising from energy production and use.

Since I am teaching this course for the first time there will be changes from previous terms and I will be making official changes in desciption and prerequisits during the year.  

This is a companion course to EC 437/537 which will address regulatory and competitive policies in electricity, public transportation, water, natural,  and telecomunictions.  The order of the courses has changed to reflect the evolving nature of the field.

## New Kind of Slash Course

Students that have been at PSU for a while are familiar with "slash courses" where both undergraduates and graduate students are in the same classroom but have differnt assignments, readings and standards.  This course take it another step.  Undergraduate will meet in Mondays and Wednesdays and graduate students will meeet on Mondays and Friday. In short, we will be together on Monday. Undergraduates will meet alone on Wednesday and Graduate students will meet alone on Friday.  All students may attend all sessions if they wish.  This arrangment should allow the graduate students to explore topics in more depth.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has microecnomic theory, EC 311, or the calculus based version, EC 415, listed as prerequisits.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.

As with most economics courses, the more background you bring to the class, the more get from the class.  For this class it means microecnomic theory and econometrics.  Not all students will have a background in both and many of the graduate students from outside of economics will have neither.  Any technical skills that students are missing will be suplemented with in-class tutorials.  Sometimes this will mean learning about constrianed optimization or breaking out laptops for a tutorial on running regressions in R.

# Contact Information

The best ways of contacting me, in decreasing order of effectiveness:

+ IM/hangout: woodsj@pdx.edu
+ Phone/text: (503) 465-4883
+ Email:woodsj@pdx.edu (Answered only on M W and F)
+ D2L email: Do not use.  I will not respond.

You are encouraged to use the IM function of your PSU email account, or text, rather than email. This will allow me to get back to you more quickly and more conversationally. Please be aware that I will likely not reply till the next day if you IM me after 5pm or on the weekend.  

Office Hours:

+ My office is in CH 241-O.
+ Drop in office hours are Tuesday 3-4pm  through the last week of class. There is no need to make an appointment for these hours -- just come.
+ If you canâ€™t attend regular office hours, please check my calendar \url{https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/}. I will make a limited number of 15 minute slots available each week. If you make an appointment and fail to show up without first canceling, I will penalize you one quiz grade.  

# Textbook and Other Resources

The main text for the course is Dahl, Carol. _International Energy Markets: Understanding Pricing, Policies, & Profits._ PennWell Books, 2015.  It was chosen undergraduates in mind and illustrates many of the concepts they learned in EC 311/415.

This text will be heavily suplemented with material from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) https://www.eia.gov/, the texbook authors website (http://dahl.mines.edu/), and journal articles available electronically through the library.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

# Topics and Readings

Do not let this section alarm you.  We will only address part of this outline in the class. As with most of my upper division courses, we will complete a small subset at the start of the class and then vote on each suceeding topic.

Each topic has some readings that both undergraduates and graduate students will read and some that are specific to each.  If you are a graduate student that is trying to rapidly get up to speed on a topic, I recomend looking at the undergraduate readings in addition to your own.

+ Introduction of Core Topics
  + Starting on Topic   
    + "Energy Primer: A Handbook of Energy Market Basics", FERC, 2015 (http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/guide/energy-primer.pdf), Chapter 1
    + Dahl, Ch 1-2.
  + Coal
    + Dahl, Ch 3.
  + Natural Gas
    + Dahl, Ch 8.
    + Energy Primer, Ch 2.
  + Electricity
    + Energy Primer, Ch 3. 
    + Dahl, Ch 5-6.   
  + Oil
    + Dahl, Ch 7.
    + Energy Primer, Ch 4.
    
+ Topic Options, Voted on in Class


# Other Rules

+ Begging for grades will result in an immediate lowering of your course grade by a full letter grade.
  
+ When completing assignments you may use your book, wiki, calculator, spreadsheets, notes, or other resources as long as it is not another student or person unless the assignment allows.  *The work must be authentically and genuinely your own. In other words, if you are copying answers you found online, it is not your work.*
  
+ Go to office hours at the first sign of trouble -- not as a last resort.

+ In this classroom, we support and value diversity.  To do so requires that we:

    + Respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals
    + Promote a culture of respect toward all individuals
    + Respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others
    + Reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind
    + Practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others
    + Promote the diversity of opinions, ideas, and backgrounds, which is the lifeblood of a university

   For additional information, please see the Office of Affirmative Action \& Equal Opportunity at \url{http://www.pdx.edu/diversity/affirmative-action}.


+ Accommodations are collaborative efforts between students, faculty, and the Disability Resource Center.  If you have a documented disability and require accommodation, you must arrange to meet with the course instructor prior to or within the first week of the term.  The documentation of your disability must come in writing from the Disability Resource Center (Faculty letter).  Students who believe they are eligible for accommodations but who have not yet obtained approval through the DRC should contact the DRC immediately.  Reasonable and appropriate accommodations will be provided for students with documented disabilities.  For more information on the Disability Resource Center, please see \url{http://www.drc.pdx.edu/}. 

+ Academic honesty is expected and required of students enrolled in this course.  Suspected academic dishonesty in this course will be handled according to the procedures set out in the Student Code of Conduct.

+ I am sympathetic to family emergencies but you must inform me as soon as possible. If the notice is verbal, please email me with your understanding of our agreement. All agreements have to be in writing.
