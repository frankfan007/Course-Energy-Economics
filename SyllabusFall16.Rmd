# Course Description

The official description of the course is:
> Economics and structure of energy markets, with a focus on electricity. Examines current policy issues arising from energy production and use.

Since I am teaching this course for the first time there will be changes from previous terms and I will be making official changes in desciption and prerequisits during the year.  

This is a companion course to EC 437/537 which will address regulatory and competitive policies in electricity, public transportation, water, natural,  and telecomunictions.  The order of the courses has changed to reflect the evolving nature of the field.

## New Kind of Slash Course

Students that have been at PSU for a while are familiar with "slash courses" where both undergraduates and graduate students are in the same classroom but have differnt assignments, readings and standards.  This course take it another step.  Undergraduate will meet in Mondays and Wednesdays and graduate students will meeet on Mondays and Friday. In short, we will be together on Monday. Undergraduates will meet alone on Wednesday and Graduate students will meet alone on Friday.  All students may attend all sessions if they wish.  This arrangment should allow the graduate students to explore topics in more depth.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has microecnomic theory, EC 311, or the calculus based version, EC 415, listed as prerequisits.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.

As with most economics courses, the more background you bring to the class, the more get from the class.  For this class it means microecnomic theory and econometrics.  Not all students will have a background in both and many of the graduate students from outside of economics will have neither.  Any technical skills that students are missing will be suplemented with in-class tutorials.  Sometimes this will mean learning about constrianed optimization or breaking out laptops for a tutorial on running regressions in R.

# Contact Information

The best ways of contacting me, in decreasing order of effectiveness:

+ IM/hangout: woodsj@pdx.edu
+ Phone/text: (503) 465-4883
+ Email:woodsj@pdx.edu (Answered only on M W and F)
+ D2L email: Do not use.  I will not respond.

You are encouraged to use the IM function of your PSU email account, or text, rather than email. This will allow me to get back to you more quickly and more conversationally. Please be aware that I will likely not reply till the next day if you IM me after 5pm or on the weekend.  

Office Hours:

+ My office is in CH 241-O.
+ Drop in office hours are Tuesday 3-4pm  through the last week of class. There is no need to make an appointment for these hours -- just come.
+ If you can’t attend regular office hours, please check my calendar \url{https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/}. I will make a limited number of 15 minute slots available each week. If you make an appointment and fail to show up without first canceling, I will penalize you one quiz grade.  

# Textbook and Other Resources

The main text for the course is Dahl, Carol. _International Energy Markets: Understanding Pricing, Policies, & Profits._ PennWell Books, 2015.  It was chosen undergraduates in mind and illustrates many of the concepts they learned in EC 311/415.

This text will be heavily suplemented with material from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) https://www.eia.gov/, the texbook authors website (http://dahl.mines.edu/), and journal articles available electronically through the library.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

This class will be taught as a collaborative seminar with limited traditional lecture. There are no exams but
there will be a considerable amount of writing and analysis, presentations by teams of student researchers
and several referee reports. Nearly all work product will be made public to the class though your grade will not.

## Team Assignments

Teams will be assigned by the instructor durring the first week of class. They will be composed of at least one
graduate student and one undergraduate student. Assignments will be made based a survey of completed
math, economics and statistics courses. The intent is to ensure that each team has the skills it needs to
succeed.

The teams are intended to encourage cooperative learning where graduate students can assist undergraduate
students with concepts they are unsure of and those with exceptional skills can share insight with
others.

A team may remove a member by an anonymous 3/4th majority vote of a current members. Removed
members will act as a team of one until other teams remove members or students join the class. Removed
members may join other teams by an anonymous 3/4th majority vote of the receiving team. All votes will
be conducted by the instructor should two students on a team request a vote. The instructor reserves the
right to reassign students to teams should there be large differences in team size.

Team assignements will be a diverse selection of activities that will range from creating a day ahead electricity forecast, explaining a crack spread with current data, or just sorting out a nasty diagram in the book.

## Individual/Group Term Paper

The largest assignment will be a term paper and will account for X% of your grade. The term paper may be
either a literature review, in which case it must be completed by an individual or an empirical/theoretical
paper which may have up to three co-authors. Graduate students
must complete an empirical/theoretical paper. Term paper preparation and evaluation will be in stages.

1. Authors and co-authors must publish an abstract, including a few key references, in the “Draft Abstracts”
discussion topic and schedule a 30 minute review meeting with the instructor by DATE1. Scope and depth changes will be agreed to in the meeting.

2. A revised abstract must be submitted by DATE2 and will be published in the “Final Abstracts”
discussion topic. Abstracts will be discussed in class and online. A minimum of two reviewers will be
assigned to each paper. Ideally no reviewer will be assigned more than one paper.

3. Authors and co-authors will construct an annotated bibliography. A reasonably complete annotated bibliography will be
available for the class to review by DATE3 and  should be provided in “Final Abstracts” discussion topic.

4. Authors and co-authors that are pursuing an empirical paper must schedule a 20-minute presentation
to the class on data collection, design and analysis approach prior to completion of the draft paper.
Additional problem solving presentations are encouraged. Students conducting a literature review should schedule a similar session for a key papers in their literature review. 

5. A draft of the paper must be published in the “Draft Papers” discussion topic by DATE4. The
referees will deliver a referee report on your draft by DATE5 as a comment to your original post.
The instructor will make additional comments after the reports are received.

6. The final paper must be published to the “Final Papers” disussion topic by DATE6. Term papers
must be less than 20 pages.

## Referee Reports

+ A referee report on a student’s or group’s draft paper. You will be assigned a paper to review. The
report must be less than five pages, will be evaluated on a 0 to 5 scale and will constitute 10% of your
grade. This is due by DATE8 and must be posted as a comment on the draft paper in the “Draft
Papers” topic.

+ A referee report on a student’s or group’s final paper. This will be a second review of the paper you
previously reviewed. The report must be less than five pages, will be evaluated on a 0 to 5 scale and
will constitute 5% of your grade. This referee report will be delivered by the day of the final exam,
DATE9 and published as a comment to the paper in the “Final Papers” topic.

Details on what consitutes a referee report and examples of referee reports will be presented in class. The report will be evaluated on a 0 to 5 scale with the following rubric. 
 + 0 Points Base
 + 1 Points Rudimentary synopsis and minor criticisim of the paper.
 + 2 Points Report gives an accurate synopis of paper and the contribution it makes to the literature.
 + 3 Points 2 AND identifies and explains weaknesses in the analysis or gaps in the literature.
 + 4 Points 3 AND provides suggested articles to be included and several options that would improve
analysis.
 + 5 Points Exemplary example of 4.

# Topics and Readings
