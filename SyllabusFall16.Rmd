# Course Description

The official description of the course is:
> Economics and structure of energy markets, with a focus on electricity. Examines current policy issues arising from energy production and use.

Since I am teaching this course for the first time there will be changes from previous terms and I will be making official changes in desciption and prerequisits during the year.  

This is a companion course to EC 437/537 which will address regulatory and competitive policies in electricity, public transportation, water, natural,  and telecomunictions.  The order of the courses has changed to reflect the evolving nature of the field.

## New Kind of Slash Course

Students that have been at PSU for a while are familiar with "slash courses" where both undergraduates and graduate students are in the same classroom but have differnt assignments, readings and standards.  This course take it another step.  Undergraduate will meet in Mondays and Wednesdays and graduate students will meeet on Mondays and Friday. In short, we will be together on Monday. Undergraduates will meet alone on Wednesday and Graduate students will meet alone on Friday.  All students may attend all sessions if they wish.  This arrangment should allow the graduate students to explore topics in more depth.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has microecnomic theory, EC 311, or the calculus based version, EC 415, listed as prerequisits.  The graduate section requires only graduate standing.
