## DER vs DG

+ DG = Distributed Generation
+ DER = DG + Storage

May seem like semantics but small storage grew in potential since 2005

##  What is in DER

+ Definitions vary but Small (< 49MW) generation seems to count with < 1MW most common.
    + Plenty of renewable
    + Small turbine
    + Backup generators
    + Battery banks.
+ Combined Heat and Power
    + Steam Generation
    + Chill Water
    + District Energy
    
## Why Would I (Private) Build It?

+ Power Quality
    + Equipment is sensitive to voltage drops or spikes
    + Equipment is sensitive to frequency variation.
    + Wave shape and harmonics
    + High reactive power needs (Often avoids utility charge.)
    
+ Reliability (Often combined with quality)
    + High cost of interrupted power, e.g., hospital
    + Two common measures 
        + System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), average total time without power over a year.
        + Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI), average time without given your power is out.
        + Many more relating to frequency and cost of lost service.
    + You could have lower rates if you have an interruptible tariff.    


## Why Would I (Private) Build It? (Cont)

+ Peak reduction
    + If you have demand (kW) charges, your maximum use.
    + If you have a coincident peak (kW) charge, you use at system peak.

+ Cogeneration Opportunity
    + Already need Steam or Chill water
    + Electricity generation is a bonus
      
+ Reduction in volumetric (kWh) charges
    + Net metering just a bit to shave off the high block charges
    + Peak Pricing Tariff
    + Real-time Prices.
    + Nice subsidy.
    + Actually, social cost, cheaper.
    
+ The utility side is significantly more complicated.

## Three simple ways of thinking about costs

+ The Make vs Buy trade-off (TC).
+ The Minimum Efficient Scale (AC), i.e., volume such that AC is at a minimum.
+ Investment Delay, a time value of money concept.

With all cost estimates the key conceptual problem is to only look at incremental costs.

+ It is often unclear what those incremental costs are relative to.  
+ Cost does depend on your point of view.

## Example Make vs Buy

## Example MES

## Example Investment Delay
