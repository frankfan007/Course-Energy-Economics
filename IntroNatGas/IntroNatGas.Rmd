## Where is it produced? Just conventional
![](http://dualstack.prod-http-80-test-412114078.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/w/images/1/13/EIA-conventional-gas.pdf)

## More in the shale areas.

## Fracking Well. Will see with oil well with associated gas

## How do you move it within the US? Pipelines (Interstate only).

## What about those pipelines?
+ There are more intrastate pipelines than shown, plenty in TX and CA but also other states
+ Read more here https://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/transcorr.html
    + Picture pipes ranging from a foot to three+ feet for trunk lines.
    + Compressor stations every 50-100 miles, ~1,500 total
    + 200 psi to 1,500 depending
+ They are privatly owned https://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/MajorInterstatesTable.html
    + Open access, posted prices, is a thing.
    + For intrastate, withing, state PUC regulate
    + For interstate, FERC regulates (You can find current Tarrifs at http://etariff.ferc.gov/TariffList.aspx)

## Storage is important

## Most Storage is just old gas wells

## Hubs, where transactions are made

## Part of Henry Hub LA

## Getting to Prices
+ You will see wellhead prices, but
+ Most references prices are at the hubs.  
    + Henry Hub in LA is the most common reference hub for prices
    + There are fairly firm relationships between other hubs and HH except when there is congestion.
    + Changes in the usual difference are usually called basis blowout. Term is not specific to energy.
