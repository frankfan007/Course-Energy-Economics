## Oil is for Cars

+ Keep in mind that oil is primarily a transportation fuel.
    + Yes, some diesel and even crude is used for electricity production (5%), but
    + mostly we make gasoline and other commodities out of it.


## Oil is not a uniform commodity

+ It varies specific gravity
    + Lighter oils are more valuable because it is cheaper to crack into the products you want
+ Sulfur content
    + Low sulfur is cheaper to crack
+ Location
    + Transportation is not cheap
    + Pipelines, train, tanker all have trad-offs with cost and safety and reliability.
    + Sometimes law and conflict can disrupt transportation
    
    
## Sulfer v Density of World Oil

## _Prices_ of oil not _Price_ of oil

+ Many commonly cited prices
    + Even this list is incomplete https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_crude_oil_products
    + Brent (North Sea) and 
    + West Texas Intermediate are common for both US and international.
+ WTI less so 
    + Shale oil with limited transportation means WTI tends to be lower by a few dollars.
    + Will likely change
        + More pipelines
        + Repeal of _mostly_ prohibited export of crude.

+ There are smaller price points by city and region
+ Many are specified as blends of typical out put of various regions.


## Location

+ Refineries are tuned to a specific kind of oil
    + If density or sulfur changes too much they have to remodel or variable suffer a cost hit.
+ Oil in new areas needs transport

        + Truck
        + Rail
        + Pipeline
        + Boat
+ Safety
    + (Death, Property) Truck > Rail > Pipeline > Boat
    + (Spilled) Truck > Pipeline > Rail > Boat
    + (Environment) Boat > Pipeline > Truck > Rail 


## The Markets for oil are complex and odd

+ The oddness comes from it being a key commodity
    + No oil, no cars
    
+ US uses about 15 MMbd (Million Barrels a day)
    + Half domestic and half imported
    + Imports are mostly Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico  
    
+ We hold massive inventories of oil and gas
    + https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/pdf/table1.pdf
        + Domestic production 8.504 MMbd
        + Imports 6.601 MMbd
    + Inventory
        + Crude 1,162.2 MMb, about 77 days of inventory
        + Gasoline 226 MMb at 9 MMbd or 25 days of inventory

## Textbook focues on Monopoloy models and Anti-trust
  
  + The anti-trust is great and historically relevant
      + Oil was one of the drivers of the anti-trust movement
      + It is historically relevant
  + The monopoly style analysis is also historically relevant
      + When there were a few major gasoline marketers, yes
      + When there were a few international cartels, yes
  + The political models of OPEC are also good for a few limited time periods
  
## The Paper Focuses on some inventory aguments

+ There is a strong desire to hold inventories of oil.
+ The size of inventories depends on expectations about
    + future prices
    + and when price is fixed, expectations about supply availability
+ This focus on inventories and expectations
    + Forces analysis of oil markets to use techniques from macro
    + Some work on expectations in paper
    + Does not do the full Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium approach


## Flow and Stock Models

+ Marshallian Supply and Demand are flow concepts, consumption over time.
+ Not right for stock demands, which is why macro has a lot of odd models to deal with money
       + Cash in advance
       + Debt in overlapping generations
+ There is a S/D approximation of a way of interpreting a Hamiltonian system but messy.
    + One version is in Knittel, Christopher R. and Robert S. Pindyck. 2016. "The Simple Economics of Commodity Price Speculation." American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 8(2): 85-110. http://stats.lib.pdx.edu/proxy.php?url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20140033
    + It is messy with some hand waving but easier than learning about phase diagrams.
    
## Expectation Formation

+ Rational Expectations: Everyone in the model has a model and on average their models make correct predictions

+ Adaptive Expectations: Make guesses based on the past

+ Paper adds the idea of Who's expectations because how they form expectations is different.

## VARs Vector Auto Regressions 

+ Adaptive, uses the past
+ Choose variables and then make sure they are of the same order of integration, e.g., levels or changes.
+ Look for a fixed linear relationship, cointegration
+ Use past and current values of all variables to explain current values of all variables.

Use:
+ Plug and chug forecasts (seen in paper fig 3)
+ Impulse response.  Start with a quiet system and flick one variable at a time and see how the flick propagates.

## Impulse Response Example

## Financial Markets vs Policy Makers

+ Paper gives arguments about differences between the two
    + Financial market have more info than can go in models
    + Financial markets can ignore or misinterpret data.
    
+ Futures contracts have a built in bias
    + A risk premium.  The paper uses Hamilton-Wu estimates but there are others.
    
## Bubble and pari-mutal arguments

+ Lots of shared information including prices of futures
+ If you see prices rising you may buy based only on that
    + Assume others know something you don't
    + How bubbles happen amplifying a small difference
+ Grandpa Ish's Lesson on Betting Horses
    + Don't bet on the horse you think will win
    + Bet on the horse that pays off more than you think it should.
    + If people do this, hard to see best guess.
    + If they don't, bubbles.

## Fun Fact

+ Simple prediction rules work great when more sophisticated rules cost more than the benefit they bring.

+ Why consumers use simple rules.  Gas prices will change by about the same amount as inflation.

## The Events

+ The 1973/74 Oil Crisis
+ The 1979/80 Oil Crises
+ The 1980s and 1990s
+ From the Great Surge of 2003–08 to the Global Financial Crisis


## The 1973/74 Oil Crisis
+ Timing and location does not work for war driven supply shock.
+ Prices received by governments was fixed in the 1971 Tehran/Tripoli agreements
    + Inflation hits and real prices are low
    + Global economic boom increases commodity demand.
+ With the low fixed price all but Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had no spare capacity
+ October 10, 1973 Tehran/Tripoli dead
+ Price increases, it is negotiated, but is it nearer competitive or monopoly price?

## Competitive or Monopoly?

+ Other commodities increased by about 75% as much as oil.
+ Only part of the big jump was a jump because of monopoly power
+ Remainder was effect of
    + Eliminating the fixed prices
    + Increase commodity demand
    
+ Price controls and rationing in US did not help.


## The 1979/80 Oil Crises

+ WTI from $15 to $40
+ Traditional story was Iranian revolution
    + Timing is off. WTI hit $40 after revolution when Iran was back at full production.
+ Two shocks
    + Commodity demand increase (2/3 increase)
    + Expectation shock (1/3 increase)
        + If a disruption can happen in Iran then it can happen anywhere.
        + Explore more
        + Increase Inventory


## The 1980s and 1990s

+ Traditional argument is the Iran/Iraq war disrupted supply but there was little change in price.
    + Even with tankers being attacked.
+ Hangover from the 70s events
    + Lots of exploration in new areas, e.g. North Sea
    + Lots of inventory
+ First Real OPEC effort to push towards monopoly prices
    + Per Theory, everyone cheats.

## There was a spike, a slump, a slump and a spike

+ Gulf 1 1990
    + Iraq and Kuwait oil disrupted
    + Large inventory demand anticipating Saudi Arabia attack

+ Asian Financial Crisis 1997
    + Reduced commodity demand
    
+ Venezuela 2002
    + BTW Huge reserves of oil
    
+ Gulf 2 2003
    + $6 increase is hardly a shock

## From the Great Surge of 2003–08 to the Global Financial Crisis

+ WTI from 28 to 134
+ Increased global demand for commodities including oil.
    + Wave to China
    + Small increase in inventory demand
    + Little evidence of speculation
+ 2008
    + Recession and prices go down to 100
    + Why not further is confusing given the scale of the increase.
    
+ 2014 The fall to $47
    + $11 of $49 decline was commodity decline
    + $16 because of shale boom
    + $9 Storage (expectation) shock.
