## Oil is for Cars

+ Keep in mind that oil is primarily a transportation fuel.
    + Yes, some diesel and even crude is used for electricity production (5%), but
    + mostly we make gasoline and other commodities out of it.


## Oil is not a uniform commodity

+ It varies specific gravity
    + Lighter oils are more valuable because it is cheaper to crack into the products you want
+ Sulfer content
    + Low sulfer is easier to crack
+ Location
    + Tranportation is not cheap
    + Piplines, train, tanker all have tradoffs with cost and safety and reliability.
    + Sometimes law and conflict can disrupt tranportation

## Prices of oil not Price of oil

+ Many commonly cited prices
    + Brent (North Sea) and 
    + West Texas Intermediate are common for both US and international.
+ WTI less so 
    + Shale oil with limited transportation means WTI tends to be lower by a few dollars.
    + Will likely change
        + More pipelines
        + Repeal of _mostly_ prohibited export of crude.

+ There are smaller price points by city and region
+ Many are specified as blends of typical out put of various regions.

## The Markets for oil are complex and odd

+ The oddness comes from it being a key commodity
    + No oil, no cars
    
+ US uses about 15 MMbd (Million Barrels a day)
    + Half domestic and half imported
    + Imports are mostly Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico  
    
+ We hold massive inventories of oil and gas
    + https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/pdf/table1.pdf
        + Domestic production 8.504 MMbd
        + Imports 6.601 MMbd
    + Inventory
        + Crude 1,162.2 MMb, about 77 days of inventory
        + Gasoline 226 MMb at 9 MMbd or 25 days of inventory

## Textbook focues on Monopoloy models and Anti-trust
  
  + The anti-trust is great and historically relevent
      + Oil was one of the drivers of the anti-trust movement
      + It is historcially relevent
  + The monopoly style analysis is also historically relevent
      + When there were a few major gasoline marketers, yes
      + When ther were a few international cartells, yes
  + The political models of OPEC are also good for a few limited time periods
