## Next Topic

+ Financial Markets. Black-Scholes and the odd products that are available with electricity and oil.
+ Intro to Externalities and Public Goods.  Carbon taxes, cap and trade and renewable portfolio standards.
+ Natural Gas Outside the US.  Reading in syllabus is minimal but will expand.
+ Price Controls and Subsidies (Not Carbon Taxes and Implicit Subsidies).  Reading in syllabus is minimal but will expand.
+ Market Monitoring.  EIA reports and the possibility of reading through the Enron scandal in the Fortnightly.
+ Hotelling's Rule and Dynamic Extraction.
+ Supply and Cost Curves.  Book has a lot of present value calculations and will give some of the how to on creating the levelized cost estimates.
+ Energy Demand.  My favorite topic.  This includes energy efficiency.
+ Distributed Generation.  Lots of dockets in NY about this as well as the reactions of Hawaii to massive rooftop solar.

## Last Week

+ We looked at the changes in oil prices from the point of view of a more competitive model with expectations and inventory demand driving changes.
+ Has an Occam's razor advantage over the monopoly models commonly offered.
+ But there is still room for a monopoly power explanation.

## Monopoly in the short run

+ $P_m>P_{pc}$
+ $Q_m<Q_{pc}$
+ Dead weight loss and increase in producer surplus.

## Monopoly in the long run

+ k adjusts so that where $MR = LRAC$
+ $MC=MR=SRAC$
+ Costs are still minimized

## Monopoly Can Be Price Regulated

+ Requires a ceiling below $P_m$ and greater than or equal to $P_{pc}$
+ Results in a welfare improvement
+ Part of the logic behind CPI-X regulation
+ Complicated kink in MR develops
+ Kills monopoly if $P<AC$
+ Cool property that as $P_{c}$ decreases, $Q^*$ increases. Opposite of perfect competition

## Tax A Monopolist?

+ Books says you can't tax a monopolist to be more efficient.
    + Has not stopped people from trying, note 50% tax rate in 1950s.
    + The tax is less about efficiency and more about equity and government revenue requirements.
+ You can improve welfare with a subsidy
    + Falls on the equity criteria
    
## Oil Independence Argument

I have oil and but you have more oil and it is cheaper.

+ I become independent and use all my oil.  Who has power now?
+ I buy your oil and save mine.  Now who has power?

+ Look at the Hottelling Rule, extract so that the price increases at the rate of interest.
    + Funny that this doesn't happen very often.
    + Lots of assumptions.

## Multi-plant monopoly

+ Two plants: One with high and one with low marginal costs.
+ Horizontal summation of individual MC results in joint MC.
    + Book shows a kink.  Gets flatter as the higher cost plant starts to produce.
    + More plants, more kinks.
+ Profit maximizing is as usual $MR=MC$.
+ Individual plant production
    + Find $AR^*$ then 
    + Find the Q such that MC of each firm equals $AR^*$
+ Note that profit maximizing production is allocated based on cost
    + Not reserves
    + Not population 
    + Not revenue requirements
    
## Why This is A Problem for OPEC or any Cartel

+ Cooperation requires that each be at least as well off as they would be without participating.
    + At some levels of demand, some members of cartel should not produce.
+ Many ways of splitting profits
    + By production 
    + By reserves
    + By marginal costs
    + Other


## How to Break Splitting Profits

+ By production 
    + Produce as much as you can and depend on the cartel to store or destroy.
    + Ocean Spray approach.
+ By reserves
    + Madly explore
    + Hard to reach oil is as valuable as easy oil. Venezuela
+ By marginal costs
    + Need a lump-sum transfer to non-producers to work.
    
In the end, cartels mix methods and take into account political and government revenue needs.

## Wait?  Politics and Government Revenue?

+ Assumes a lot of government control over oil, which is true in many places.
+ Favorable prices can be used to build alliances
    + Cuba and USSR
    + Venezuela and the Caribbean Basin
+ Explicitly removes the objective of profit maximizing and changes to:
    + Revenue maximization or
    + Profit maximization subject to revenue constraint
    
## Connect Oil Revenue to Macroeconomics

+ Marginal Efficiency of Investment
    + Macro concept.  Relationship between internal rate of return on investment and the scale of investment.
    + Inverse relationship
    + Optimal is where the interest rate, marginal cost, is equal to MEI, marginal benefit.
    
+ Optimal governmental investment determined by MEI-r

+ Many combinations of P and Q satisfy
    + If revenue requirement can not be achieved, firms revenue maximize, $MR=0$
    + If revenue requirement can be achieved, firm may reduce output from from $MC$ splitting to allow others to have more revenue.
        + Probably why Saudi Arabia is the "swing producer".
        + Why privatized Aramco, owned by Saudi government since 1980, would make it very hard to collude.

## Does the Monopoly Argument Add Anything?
  
+ OPEC only seems to be able to collude when there are macro expansions.
+ Consistent with dynamic collusion arguments.
    + Decide if colluding now and receiving monopoly rents is worth more than
    + Not colluding and receiving more now but few monopoly rents in future.
    + Collusion when future demand is expect high
    + Collusion fails when future demand is expected low.
+ Dynamic component is missing in the traditional monopoly arguments.
+ Even then demand for commodities explains a lot.
